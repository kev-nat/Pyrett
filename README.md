# Pyrett [Pyro Fighter Turre]ðŸ§¯
Pyrett is an AI guided water turret fire supression system, which allows for the quick extinguishing of fires within a specified area. Using a combination of YOLOv8 and a gantry mechanism, we were able to create a functional and high precision prototype.

### BackgroundðŸ’¡
Many fires happen in homes and businesses every year, and people usually use sprinklers to put them out. But sprinklers can cause a lot of water damage to the property, sometimes more than the fire itself. Thatâ€™s because sprinklers spray water everywhere until someone turns them off, and they need to be replaced after each use. This can ruin things like electronics, machines, furniture, etc and cost a lot of money to fix. We made a water turret that can find and target a fire using a smart algorithm and put it out precisely. This way, we can stop the fire faster and use less water, and avoid damaging the property with too much water.
