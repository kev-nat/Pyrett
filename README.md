### BackgroundðŸ’¡
<p align="justify"> Residential and commercial fires remain a common hazard. While traditional sprinkler systems effectively suppress flames, they often cause extensive water damage by spraying indiscriminately until manually shut off. This can destroy sensitive assets such as electronics, machinery, and furniture. In many cases, the cost of repairing water damage surpasses the damage caused by the fire itself, emphasizing the need for a more precise and automated solution. </p>
